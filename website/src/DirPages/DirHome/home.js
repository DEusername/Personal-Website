                    Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Duncan Everson, and I've created this
                    website to act as a storage for my professional projects. I've also included
                    some facts about my character and skills on this site too, so feel free to
                    also examine those. If you would like to reach out to me, please feel free to
                    email me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enjoy my website!
